# Grind-101 — DSA, DAA & Problem Solving

A collection of all the algorithmic adventures I willingly signed up for.
LeetCode, university coursework, random practice problems — if it made me question my life choices at 2 AM, it's probably in here.

## 📊 LeetCode & Problem Solving

A steadily expanding set of solutions covering:

* Arrays & Strings
* Trees & Graphs
* Sliding Window / Two Pointers
* Dynamic Programming
* Backtracking
* Greedy
* Bit Manipulation
* Math

Every solution is written with clean logic, minimal nonsense, and zero blind copy–paste from editorial hell.

## 📘 Coursework (DAA + DSA)

Includes implementations used for academic work:

* Expression parsing
* Sorting (merge sort, quicksort, multiway merge)
* Linked list operations (singly, doubly, circular, polynomial)
* Binary Trees & BST
* Sliding-window exercises
* Tutorials and weekly assignments

Basically, all the “write this from scratch or you fail” type problems.
